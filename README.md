# Aerofoils learner

Convolutional neural network to learn the maximum lift-to-drag ratio at angle for 2D aerofoils. 

Aerofoils downloaded from airfoiltools.com, with aerodynamic data provided by XFoil.

# To Do
- create aerofoil augmentation script.
- write the decoder (transpose of convolutions).

# Notes
- neural network depreciated. Current work is being completed on the convolutional neural network only.
